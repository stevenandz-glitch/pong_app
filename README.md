# Pong Web Application
This is a web application programmed in HTML, CSS, and Javascript in which it is inspired by the classic game **Pong**. Here, there are two paddles, each controled by an entity, and the main objective it to be the first to achive a certain number of points before the other where the a point is gained when the ball passes the border. The paddles themselves can be controlled by a player, or a computer. For this project, I decided that the game play should be *player vs. computer*, where one paddle is controlled by the user, and the other is programmed to predict where the ball will go. The main areas of interest for this project will be in **HTML** where I practice using the `canvas` element, and in **Javascript** where I utilize mathematical concepts such as geometry and velocity. While those areas are the topic of discussion, I will acknowledge that this project helped introduce me to `embedded-systems`. Because it is small, there will not be much time spend on the front-end development process, but rather on the back-end, "oh my gosh I'm doing physics," logic.
